- 👋 Hi, I’m @ThiviyaApp
- 👀 I’m interested in Data Analytics
- 🌱 I’m currently taking an entry-level course on Data Analytics through the KYDP Program.
- 💞️ This GitHub will mainly serve as my portfolio to be shown to potential employers
- 📫 Reach me through my LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/thiviya-appaneu/
- 😄 Pronouns: She/Her
- ⚡ Fun fact: Before diving into the world of data, I majored in Psychology. I believe I'll be able to combine my understanding of human behavior with data analysis to solve complex problems in a whole new way as I grow further within this field.
